At present we are having enough resources like, fuel, electricity.,e.t.c.. But for your future generations there will be not if we waste resources. This made me too think. Now-a-days everyone is using a smartphone. Smartphone is the only thing through which ever person can connect (or) communicate thorough out the world. To run a smartphone, we needPower to charge battery. How many are you charging your smartphone whole night? Some time I also did it. Due to charging our phone for a long time our battery spoil and we are wasting one of the most useful non-renewable resources (I.e. coal for producing electricity).

For to save electricity and batter spoiling issue. I came up with a solution called “Battery Alarm”. Battery Alarm is an application (app) on our smartphone from which we can save electricity. Let`s see how it happened!

Basically, we are humans we all having a busy schedule. So that we are simply forgot your phone in charging socket throughout the night. To achieve our goal, we need to do is simply ringing our phone up by an alarm. Which gives us remainder to take out phone from the charging socket.
